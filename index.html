            <div id="viz-a"></div>
            <p>This first visualization is meant to allow the reader to preliminary explore the data and to answer the question of <span class="text-primary">what is the relationship between penicillin versus streptomycin and penicillin versus neomycin</span>. This relationship is focused on the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) value which is a continuous variable. Since penicillin is the independent variable, it will be on the x-axis while the other antibiotic (whether it is streptomycin or penicillin) is on the y-axis. The usage of a scatter plot is the most appropriate to answer this question because scatter plots can amplify cognition in terms of exploring potential correlation between penicillin and other antibiotics. Additionally, scatter plots are preferable because of the usage of two elementary perceptual tasks - position along a common scale and direction. The perception along a common scale ranks high on the hierarchy of effective perceptual tasks and the direction allows for slopes to appear.</p>
            <p>To further elaborate on the graphic, the choice and design of the axes is not arbitrary. I chose to use a log-log plot because of the variance in the MIC values. For instance, penicillin's MIC values range from 0.001 to 870 whereupon the maximum is over 100,000 times greater than the minimum. This creates an issue for displaying the data since the axes scale would either be too long or the data points will overlap on each other. As a result, the x-axis is scaled logarithmically to avoid both issues. The y-axis is designed with the same concerns in mind since the values range from 0.007 to 40 (for neomycin). The usage of a log-log plot is needed to improve the ability to decode quantitative values in order to answer the question.</p>
            <p>Since penicillin is compared to streptomycin or neomycin, colors are used to differentiate between the antibiotics which is specified via a legend. This graphic is sized to the full width of a Bootstrap container because of the wide range on the x-axis, even with the logarithmic scale. By extending the width to a comfortable size, the data points will be less likely to overlap and any overlap can perhaps be representative of clusters that exist in the data. This idea could be studied by doing k-means clustering or discriminant analysis.</p>

        <div class="viz" id="viz-2">
            <h2>Visualization #2</h2>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-xs-2"></div>
                <div class="col-xs-8">
                    <div id="viz-b"></div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>This visualization was the most suitable to answer the question of - <span class="text-primary">what is the relationship between gram staining and the potency of the various antibiotics (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin) given in the data set</span>. Since there are two categories of gram staining results (negative or positive) and three antibiotics that could be in each category, it made sense to use a bar chart. As discussed in class, I could either represent the different antibiotics by using a grouped or a divided bar chart. I chose the grouped bar chart because it utilizes the elementary perceptual task of position along a common scale, rather than the task of length. The perception of position enhances the user's ability to decode quantitative information - which is inherently important in answering the above question - from the visualization. The data to produce this graph was done by (1) sorting the species into gram staining groups and then (2) averaging the MIC value to each antibiotic within each group.</p>
            <p>On the topic of position along a common scale, this scale is the vertical axis. I initially had drawn the graphic without transforming the data. This was a mistake because the range of possible MIC values were big especially for penicillin values. This caused the scale to be stretched out to the extent where the values near the bottom of the scale were hard to distinguish using the elementary task of position. As a result, I plotted the values on a logarithmic scale in order to address the large variance of MIC values. The positions of the top of the bars are now easier to align amongst the scale and for the reader to determine quantitative values.</p>
            <p>As for delimiting between the different antibiotics, I used color with a legend to communicate the differences. For instance, blue represents penicillin in both the negative and positive groups on the x-axis. This is preferable to using different shading or shapes since there are only three antibiotics and the colors add a more appealing facade to the visual. There are grey horizontal lines that mark key values on the y-axis which correspond to the major numbers (0.1, 1, 10, 100). The major numbers are also bold since the scale on the y-axis is log 10 based - which must be clear to the reader to avoid confusion with a linear scale. The size of the chart spans 8 columns of a Bootstrap container to minimize the distance between the two groups for better comparison.</p>

        <div class="viz" id="viz-3">
            <h2>Visualization #3</h2>
            <div id="viz-c"></div>
            <p>This final visualization builds upon the previous two visualizations. Due to the variation of MIC values for penicillin, I wanted to know <span class="text-primary">which antibiotics could better treat the bacterial species that had high MIC levels for penicillin</span>. In the data set, there are 4 species with MIC values that are greater than or equal to 800. I pulled these 4 species out and determined that a scatter plot would be useful to show the change of MIC values across different antibiotics. The scatter plot would allow for the elementary perceptual tasks of position along a common scale and direction, thus enhancing the ability to decode quantitative information as well as the change. The species are also delimited by color which is labeled on the legend to avoid confusion. The lines are drawn in order to connect the dots of the same species in case readers have color blindness and to highlight the perception of direction.</p>
            <p>On the issue of axes, I again used a logarithmic y-axis to resolve the issue of high variance in the MIC values. This is needed to both keep the graph at a reasonable size while eliminating overlap of points. However, I believe it is justified that the points do overlap for penicillin because I have explicitly pulled species with the constraint that their penicillin MIC was greater than 800. It is more important that the values for streptomycin and neomycin do not have any overlap to show the change in MIC values. For the x-axis, I ordered the antibiotics by the time of discovery with penicillin being the earliest and neomycin being the latest (<a href="http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v12/n5/fig_tab/nrd3975_T1.html" target="_blank">source 1</a>,
                <a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=313662" target="_blank">source 2</a>). This could potentially lead to the reader being able to answer additional questions that involve time.</p>
            <p>In terms of the size of the graph, I decided to implement the graph with the full width of a Bootstrap container because the graph and legend need enough room to look appealing. The y-axis labels are sized to highlight bases of 10 since the scale is logarithmic. This helps enforce the concept of a logarithmic scale while the smaller ticks allow for an easier attempt at decoding quantitative information.</p>
