            <p>INFO474 Homework 2 | By Vincent Wu</p>
            <p>Curious about antibiotics? If so, check out these visualizations:
                <a href="#viz-1" class="btn btn-default">1</a>
                <a href="#viz-2" class="btn btn-default">2</a>
                <a href="#viz-3" class="btn btn-default">3</a>
            </p>

            <h2>Visualization #1</h2>
            <div id="viz-a"></div>
            <p>This first visualization is meant to allow the reader to preliminary explore the data and to potentially answer the question of "what is the relationship between penicilin versus streptomycin and penicilin versus neomycin". This relationship is focused on the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) value which is a continuous variable. Since penicilin is the independent variable, it will be on the x-axis while the other antibiotic (whether it is streptomycin or penicilin) is on the y-axis. The usage of a scatter plot is the most appropriate to answer this question because scatter plots can amplify cognition in terms of exploring potential correlation between penicilin and other antibiotics. Additionally, scatter plots are preferable because of the usage of two elementary perceptual tasks - position along a common scale and direction. The perception along a common scale ranks high on the hierarchy of effective perceptual tasks and the direction allows for slopes to appear.</p>
            <p>To further elaborate on the graphic, the axes are crucial to this graph. I chose to use a log-log plot because of the variance in the MIC values. For instance, penicilin's MIC values range from 0.001 to 870 whereupon the maximum is over 100,000 times greater than the minimum. This creates an issue for displaying the data since the axes scale would either be too long or the data points will overlap on each other. As a result, the x-axis is scaled logarithmically to avoid both issues. THe y-axis is designed with the same concerns in mind since the values range from 0.007 to 40 (for neomycin). The usage of a log-log plot is needed to improve the ability to decode quantitative values in order to answer the question.</p>
            <p>Since penicilin is compared to streptomycin or neomycin, colors are used to differentiate between the antibiotics which is specified via a legend. This graphic is sized to the full width of a Bootstrap container because of the wide range on the x-axis, even with the logarithmic scale. By extending the width to a comfortable size, the data points will be less likley to overlap and any overlap can perhaps be representative of clusters that exist in the data. This idea could be studied by doing k-means clustering or discriminant analysis.</p>

        <div class="viz" id="viz-2">
            <h2>Visualization #2</h2>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-xs-2"></div>
                <div class="col-xs-8">
                    <div id="viz-b"></div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>This visualization was the most suitable to answer the question of - what is the relationship between gram staining and the potency of the various antibiotics (penicilin, streptomycin, and neomycin) given in the data set. Since there are two categories of gram staining results (negative or positive) and three antibiotics that could be in each category, it made sense to use a bar chart. As discussed in class, I could either represent the different antibiotics by using a grouped or a divided bar chart. I chose the grouped bar chart because it utilizes the elementary perceptual task of position along a common scale, rather than the task of length. The perception of position enhances the user's ability to decode quantitative information - which is inherently important in answering the above question - from the visualization. The data to produce this graph was done by (1) sorting the species into gram staining groups and then (2) averaging the MIC value to each antibiotic within each group.</p>
            <p>On the topic of position along a common scale, this scale is the vertical axis. I initially had drawn the graphic without transforming the data. This was a mistake because the range of possible MIC values were big especially for penicilin values. This caused the scale to be stretched out to the extent where the values near the bottom of the scale were hard to distinguish using the elementary task of position. As a result, I plotted the values on a logarithmic scale in order to address the large variance of MIC values. The positions of the top of the bars are now easier to align amongst the scale and for the reader to determine quantitative values.</p>
            <p>As for delimiting between the different antibiotics, I used color with a legend to communicate the differences. For instance, blue represents penicilin in both the negative and positive groups on the x-axis. This is preferable to using different shading or shapes since there are only three antibiotics and the colors add a more appealing facade to the visual. There are grey horizontal lines that mark key values on the y-axis which correspond to the major numbers (0.1, 1, 10, 100). The major numbers are also bold since the scale on the y-axis is log 10 based - which must be clear to the reader to avoid confusion with a linear scale. The size of the chart spans 8 columns of a Bootstrap container to minimize the distance between the two groups for better comparison.</p>
